# Helium

XML toolkit for Go covering XML parsing, SAX2-style streaming, XPath 3.1,
XInclude, XSD, Relax NG, and Schematron. Started as a libxml2-style port to
Go and grew broader native Go APIs and features along the way.

## XPath 3.1 — XSD Version

The xpath3 package targets **XSD 1.1 only**. This means `+INF` is a valid lexical form for xs:double and xs:float, and xs:dateTimeStamp is a recognized type. QT3 tests with `dependency type="xsd-version" value="1.0"` are skipped.

## XSD — Version Toggle

The xsd package defaults to **XSD 1.0** and treats 1.1 as **opt-in** via `Compiler.Version(xsd.Version11)` (or a `vc:minVersion="1.1"` hint on the root `<xs:schema>` when no explicit version is set). The resolved version is frozen onto the compiled `Schema` so the `Validator` applies the same semantics. 1.0 stays the default so existing behavior and goldens are unchanged.

Implemented in 1.1 mode so far: the 1.1-only lexical forms (`+INF` for xs:double/xs:float; year `0000` on the date types — both gated in `internal/xsd/value` via a `value.Version` argument; relaxng is pinned to `value.Version10`); the 1.1 built-in datatypes (xs:dateTimeStamp, xs:dayTimeDuration, xs:yearMonthDuration, xs:anyAtomicType, xs:error); **UPA weakening** (`check_upa.go` `entriesOverlap`: in 1.1 an element competing with a wildcard is not a cos-nonambig violation — the element wins. Element-over-wildcard precedence is now ENFORCED at validation for the CHOICE case (`validate_elem.go` `matchChoice`/`tryMatchChoice`, gated on `vc.version == Version11`): a branch that consumes the current child via an element leaf AS ITS FIRST CONSUMING TERM takes precedence over one that would consume it via a wildcard, regardless of declaration order or nesting. The classifier (`particleConsumesViaElement` → `particleFirstConsumerKind`/`groupFirstConsumerKind`) is PATH-AWARE: it respects compositor order, occurrences, and emptiable prefixes (reusing `particleEmptiable`), so a LEADING wildcard inside a sequence (e.g. `sequence(any skip, element a)`) is correctly classified as wildcard-first and does NOT win element precedence even though a later element leaf in the same group also matches — only bounded first-consumer determination, no backtracking. A `skip` wildcard declared before a typed element (directly or as a leading nested term) thus no longer steals the element's child and false-accepts an invalid value. The SEQUENCE case is a remaining limitation — sequence matching is position-based/greedy, so a minOccurs=0 wildcard preceding an element can still consume the element's child); **xs:assert on complex types** (`assert.go`: parsed from complexType/restriction/extension, pre-compiled via xpath3, evaluated against the element after content validation — EBV false → invalid; inherited down the base chain); and **conditional type assignment** (`alternative.go`: `<xs:alternative>` on an element declaration selects the governing type via the first @test that holds against the element, else a testless default, else the declared type; xsi:type still takes precedence; applied at the root and all three per-child match sites); and **open content** (`opencontent.go`: `<xs:openContent>` interleave/suffix — interleave removes children whose names aren't declared and which match the wildcard, then matches the declared model on the rest; suffix matches the declared model then requires every trailing child to match the wildcard; declared-named children always go through the model per weak-wildcard precedence). **Not yet implemented** (planned, gated behind the same toggle): the **xs:assertion simple-type facet** (needs `$value` bound to the typed atomic), **xs:defaultOpenContent** (schema-level default), `xs:all` member `maxOccurs>1` and wildcards-in-all, wildcard `notNamespace`/`notQName`, `xs:override`, the general user-declarable `explicitTimezone` facet, and `vc:typeAvailable`/`vc:facetAvailable` conditional pruning. Do NOT assume these work in 1.1 mode yet. (Limitations: xs:assert's test runs against the element in the full document so it can navigate to ancestors; xs:alternative does not yet support an inline anonymous type — use a named @type.)

## XSLT 3.0 — Conformance Scope

The xslt3 package targets **Basic XSLT 3.0** conformance (W3C spec Section 27). The spec defines 8 conformance levels; only "Basic XSLT Processor" is required. The remaining 7 are optional features:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic XSLT Processor | **Target** | Core requirement |
| Schema-Awareness | In progress | `xsl:import-schema`, type annotations |
| Serialization | Implemented | xml/html/text output methods |
| Streaming | Implemented | DOM-materialization; XTSE3430 analysis |
| Higher-Order Functions | Implemented | Via xpath3 |
| XPath 3.1 | Implemented | Via xpath3 |
| Dynamic Evaluation | Implemented | `xsl:evaluate` |
| **Compatibility (1.0/2.0)** | **Not planned** | Optional per spec; 122 tests skipped legitimately |

Do NOT implement XSLT 1.0/2.0 backwards compatibility mode. Tests skipped with reason `"unsupported feature: backwards_compatibility"` or `"unsupported spec: XSLT20"` are intentionally out of scope.

## Generated Files

- NEVER modify generated files by hand. Regenerate through owning generator, e.g. `xslt3gen`.
